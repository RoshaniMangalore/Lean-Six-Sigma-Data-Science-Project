# Liver-Matching-and-Prediction-for-effective-transplantations

Background : Approximately 14,000 patients are listed and waiting for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) but only 7,000 OLTs are performed annually.
There is a need to identify who the potential liver recipient is given that there are comparatively lesser number of liver donors.

Lean Six sigma principles were adopted during the implementation of the project.

## Deliverable: 
Web Application with the following functionalities:

•	Top clinical features influencing the identification of potential recipient

•	The 5 best potential recipients for every Liver donor

•	Matching score and probability score of graft survival for every recipient






## Technologies: 

Flask : Python Web Framework 

ML algorithms implemented : Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Multi-layer Perceptron), Ensemble Model

Statistics Concepts : Chi square test , student-t test
